# Mouse NoNeed App User Manual

Mouse NoNeed is an application that allows you to control your computer mouse using hand gestures performed in front of a camera. The program tracks hand movements and recognizes gestures, so you don't have to use a traditional mouse.

## Requirements
- **Computer** running Windows / MacOS
- **Functional** webcam
- **Good** lighting for your hand
- **Running** Mouse NoNeed application

## How to Use the App
- **Show a closed fist**: Left mouse click (like a normal click).
- **Open hand wide**: Right mouse click (context menu).
- **Raise thumb up**: Scroll page up.
- **Lower thumb down**: Scroll page down.
- **Point with index finger**: Move mouse cursor (tracks finger movement in all pointing directions).

> **Note:** Hold your hand still for a moment for the gesture to be detected. If something isn't working, check the lighting and distance from the camera.

## Customizing Gestures and Movements in the App Interface
The application offers the ability to personalize gestures directly in its user interface. You can change movement assignments to functions according to your preferences (e.g., assign a different gesture to scrolling).

1. On the right side of the program, find the **Gestures** tab.
2. Press the **"Edit"** button next to the gesture you want to edit, then assign it a new function from the available options.
3. Save changes.

This allows you to tailor the app to your needs, making it even more comfortable and functional for your own preferences.

## Tips and Troubleshooting
- **Camera not showing image?** Make sure the camera is turned on and not being used by another program.
- **Gestures not working as they should?** Try to light your hand better or move closer to the camera. Remember to use the camera against a uniform background.
- **Program lagging?** Close other applications using the camera and try again.
